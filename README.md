## ü§î UNDERSTANDING TASKS VS OPERATIONS VS EXECUTIONS

This is **CRUCIAL** for understanding real costs:

### **Zapier - "Tasks"**

- **Only successful ACTION steps count**
- **Multiplied by number of items processed**
- **Triggers are FREE**

**Example:** 4 actions √ó 100 customers = **400 tasks**

### **Make - "Operations"**

- **EVERY module run counts** (including triggers)
- **Multiplied by "bundles" (items)**
- **Even checking for data costs 1 operation**

**Example:** 5 modules √ó 100 customers = **500 operations**

### **n8n - "Executions"**

- **One flat fee per COMPLETE workflow run**
- **Unlimited steps/nodes per execution**
- **Unlimited data processing**

**Example:** Complex 50-step workflow processing 10,000 records = **1 execution**

### **The Bottom Line:**

- **Simple workflows:** Zapier (free triggers)
- **Complex workflows:** n8n (flat fee regardless of complexity)
- **Visual building:** Make (but watch operations add up)
