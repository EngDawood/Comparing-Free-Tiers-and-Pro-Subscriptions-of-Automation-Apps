## 🎯 Executive summary

The automation landscape continues to expand rapidly. Mature incumbents such as
Zapier, Make, and Microsoft Power Automate face sustained pressure from
open-source entrants like n8n and Activepieces, while AI-first newcomers reshape
expectations around what counts as an automation platform. Free tiers remain
generous enough for individuals and small teams to prototype real workflows, yet
billing units differ widely—tasks, operations, runs, credits, or
executions—making apples-to-apples comparisons difficult.

Key themes to track in 2025:

- **Free tiers now emphasise speed.** Higher limits and richer debugging
  encourage teams to scale before upgrading.
- **AI assistance is mainstream.** Copilots, prompt blocks, and model credits
  now ship across Zapier, Make, n8n, and AI-native tools.
- **Self-hosting is approachable.** Docker bundles and scripted installers make
  privacy-first deployments practical for lean technical teams.
- **Pricing complexity hides in metering.** Usage units vary, so model volume
  carefully before migrating mission-critical automations.

## How to use this guide

- Start with the comparison tables for a quick shortlist of candidates.
- Use the breakdown sections to understand category nuances and find platforms
  aligned with your governance, budget, and technical preferences.
- Reference the cost scenarios when forecasting monthly spend for common
  workloads.
- Cross-check pricing details against vendor pages linked throughout; note that
  offers change frequently and some vendors regionalise billing.

## 🤔 Understanding usage metrics

- **Zapier (tasks)**
  - Usage metric: Tasks
  - What counts: Successful action steps
  - Billing nuance: Triggers remain free; only completed actions consume tasks
  - Example: Four actions processed for 100 leads = 400 tasks

- **Make (operations)**
  - Usage metric: Operations
  - What counts: Every module run, including triggers, routers, and error handlers
  - Billing nuance: Polling the same scenario multiple times consumes operations
    quickly
  - Example: Five modules for 100 leads = 500 operations

- **n8n (executions)**
  - Usage metric: Executions
  - What counts: Each full workflow run regardless of node count
  - Billing nuance: Unlimited steps per execution; retries count as new executions
  - Example: A 50-node workflow for 10,000 records = 10,000 executions

- **Microsoft Power Automate (runs)**
  - Usage metric: Runs
  - What counts: Every flow execution, whether scheduled or event triggered
  - Billing nuance: Premium connectors and robotic process automation add
    surcharges
  - Example: 100 triggered flows = 100 runs

- **Pipedream (invocations and credits)**
  - Usage metric: Invocations plus credits
  - What counts: Workflow runs consume invocations; compute time drains credits
  - Billing nuance: Background tasks and long-running code draw down the 2M credit
    pool
  - Example: 100 runs with moderate compute stays within the 2M-credit allowance

### Takeaways

- Map your process into discrete steps, then simulate the billing unit before
  migrating.
- Evaluate retry and error-handling policies—automatic retries can silently
  double usage.
- Combine monitoring and alerting to avoid overruns during peak demand.
