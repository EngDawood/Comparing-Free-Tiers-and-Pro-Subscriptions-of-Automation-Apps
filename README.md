## ü§î UNDERSTANDING TASKS VS OPERATIONS VS EXECUTIONS

This is **CRUCIAL** for understanding real costs:

### **Zapier - "Tasks"**

- **Only successful ACTION steps count**
- **Multiplied by number of items processed**
- **Triggers are FREE**

**Example:** 4 actions √ó 100 customers = **400 tasks**

### **Make - "Operations"**

- **EVERY module run counts** (including triggers)
- **Multiplied by "bundles" (items)**
- **Even checking for data costs 1 operation**

**Example:** 5 modules √ó 100 customers = **500 operations**

### **n8n - "Executions"**

- **One flat fee per COMPLETE workflow run**
- **Unlimited steps/nodes per execution**
- **Unlimited data processing**

**Example:** Complex 50-step workflow processing 10,000 records = **1 execution**

### **Microsoft Power Automate - "Runs"**

- **Each workflow execution counts as 1 run**
- **Premium connectors may have additional costs**
- **Office 365 license includes basic runs**

**Example:** 100 workflow executions = **100 runs**

### **The Bottom Line:**

- **Simple workflows:** Zapier (free triggers)
- **Complex workflows:** n8n (flat fee regardless of complexity)
- **Visual building:** Make (but watch operations add up)
- **Microsoft ecosystem:** Power Automate (if you have Office 365)

# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED

When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.

1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete

**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

- Clear roadmap for implementation

- Progress tracking throughout the task

- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan

**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```
